# case-transformer
Case Transformer is a small JavaScript project that converts input text into various cases, including lowercase, uppercase, camel case, Pascal case, snake case, kebab case, and trimmed text. This tool can be useful for developers who need to quickly transform strings for different programming conventions.

## Features

**Lowercase:** Converts all characters to lowercase.
**Uppercase:** Converts all characters to uppercase.
**Camel Case:** Converts the string to camel case (e.g., `hello world` becomes `helloWorld`).
**Pascal Case:** Converts the string to Pascal case (e.g., `hello world` becomes `HelloWorld`).
**Snake Case:** Converts the string to snake case (e.g., `hello world` becomes `hello_world`).
**Kebab Case:** Converts the string to kebab case (e.g., `hello world` becomes `hello-world`).
**Trimmed Text:** Removes all spaces from the string.
